                         TWO TOO MANY

PROBLEM STATEMENT :

You are given an integer an integer 'n' as input.
Based on the input, you are required to output twice the value of 'n'.

*********************************************************************************

INPUT:
One integer 'n' (0<=n<=100).

OUTPUT:
One integer, whose value is twice that of 'n'.

*********************************************************************************
Sample Input/Output:

Input:
2
Output:
4

Input:
11
Output:
22
*********************************************************************************

TIME ALLOWED : 5sec

MEMORY LIMIT : Maximum 10^5 commands are only allowed.

*********************************************************************************

Solution:

.--#?--\  ``Takes input of the integer 'a'
.-#2--[*]  ``Initializes a  dot with the value 2 and multiplying with 'a'
       \--$#--&  ``Prints output and terminates the program

Alternatively, the following also works:

.---#?--*---\  ``Takes input, duplicates self and moves along two directions
        |   |
        \--{+}--$#--&   ``Adds the two dots, prints output and terminates the program


We don't really care which method you use, as long as the answer is right.
